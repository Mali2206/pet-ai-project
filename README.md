# Pet AI Project

This is a Python pet project created to experiment with Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-driven idea analysis.

The project allows a user to input an idea, answer a few clarifying questions, and then generates an AI-based response using a language model. The main goal of the project is to explore how prompts, user input, and LLM APIs can be combined to produce meaningful AI-generated results.

## Why this project

This project was created as a hands-on learning exercise to:

- practice Python programming
- experiment with LLM APIs in a real working flow
- understand the difference between system and user prompts
- learn how prompt structure influences model behavior
- practice Git and basic project structuring

The focus of the project is learning by doing rather than building a production-ready application.

## What I learned

While working on this project, I gained practical experience with:

- sending requests to an LLM API from Python
- handling and processing AI responses
- working with user input and prompt construction
- basic project organization and version control using Git

This project was built for learning purposes and portfolio demonstration.
